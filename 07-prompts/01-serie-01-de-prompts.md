### **How to Use the Prompts**
- Paste the prompt directly into CursorAI, Copilot, or ChatGPT.  
- If using Copilot, you may need to set up the initial file structure (e.g., `app.py` for FastAPI and `frontend.py` for Streamlit).  
- For tools like CursorAI, you can execute them directly as they generate both the backend and frontend code in one go.

These prompts provide a **clear vision** of the desired output while leaving flexibility for the AI tool to generate the full code. Let me know if you'd like more examples!
